# Minor Assignment

## Overview
This project consists of two main components:

1. **Vector Class**: A class to represent a vector (a series of float values) with operations such as creation, modification, scalar multiplication, and addition.
2. **Number Class**: A self-sufficient class to maintain an integer and perform various operations on it.

## Features

### 1. Vector Class
- Create a vector with a series of float values.
- Modify the value of a given element.
- Multiply the vector by a scalar value.
- Display the vector in the form `(10, 20, 30, ...)`.
- Add two vectors and display the resultant vector.

### 2. Number Class
- Set and get the value of an integer.
- Print the integer.
- Check if the integer is negative.
- Check if the integer is divisible by a given number.
- Get the absolute value of the integer.

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ -o main main.cpp
